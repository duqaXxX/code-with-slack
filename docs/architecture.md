# Architecture

code-with-slack is one Python process. It holds a Slack Socket Mode connection and one Claude
Agent SDK client per bound channel, all on one asyncio event loop.

## Configuration

`code_with_slack.config.load_config` reads `~/.config/code-with-slack/.env` with
`python-dotenv`, without copying anything into the process environment. It refuses a file that
is not a regular file, belongs to another user, or is readable by group or others, and it
refuses tokens of the wrong kind. [setup.md](setup.md) lists the variables.

## State and the single-instance lock

`code_with_slack.state.StateStore` keeps, for each bound channel, its directory and its Claude
Code session id, in `~/.config/code-with-slack/state.json`. Every change is written to a
temporary file beside it, synced, and renamed over it, so a crash leaves either the old file or
the new one. A file that cannot be read stops the daemon instead of being replaced.

`code_with_slack.lock.single_instance` holds an exclusive `flock` on the configuration directory
itself. A second process fails to start. The kernel releases the lock when the holder exits, so
a crash leaves no stale lock and no lock file.
